        <h2>The Flat Earth Association</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This website is dedicated to unravelling the true mysteries of the universe and demonstrating that the earth
            is flat and that Round Earth doctrine is little more than an elaborate hoax created by who wish to put chips
            in our brains to control us.</p>

        <img src="images/education.jpg" alt="teacher" class="edu"> Teacher showing a true earth model

        <p>The Flat Earth Association holds that there is a difference between believing and knowing. If you don't know
            something, and cannot understand it by first principles, then you shouldn't believe it. We must, at the very
            least, know exactly how conclusions were made about the world, and the strengths and weaknesses behind those
            deductions. Our association emphasizes the demonstration and explanation of knowledge.</p>

        <p>The site was created to address the many misconceptions a Round Earther may have about the Flat Earth Theory,
            and to act as an easily-accessible entry point into the mainstream Flat Earth model. It was designed to
            answer some of the questions that many Round Earthers raise when they first arrive. Please check this page
            before making your first threads in the forums, as it may contain the answers to the questions on your mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Beliefs</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Flat Earth Association is a group actively promoting the Flat Earth Movement worldwide. We continue the
            age-old tradition of questioning the Round Earth doctrine and challenging authorities. Acknowledging the
            link between various unconventional beliefs, the Association also occasionally engages in other
            controversial debates, striving to provide a voice for all free thinker.</p>

        <p>The most commonly accepted explanation of this is that the space agencies of the world are involved in a
            conspiracy faking space travel and exploration. This likely began during the Cold War's 'Space Race', in
            which the USSR and USA were obsessed with beating each other into space to the point that each faked their
            accomplishments in an attempt to keep pace with the other's supposed achievements. Since the end of the Cold
            War, however, the conspiracy is most likely motivated by greed rather than political gains, and using only
            some of their funding to continue to fake space travel saves a lot of money to embezzle for themselves.</p>

        <p>In light of the above, please note that we are not suggesting that space agencies are aware that the Earth is
            flat and actively covering the fact up. They depict the Earth as being round simply because that is what
            they expect it to be.</p>

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>As seen in the diagrams above, the Earth is in the form of a disk with the North Pole in the center and
            Antarctica as a wall surrounding the known continents. This is the generally accepted model among members of
            the association. In this model, circumnavigation is performed by moving in a great circle around the North
            Pole.</p>

        <p>The Earth is surrounded on all sides by an ice wall that holds the oceans back. This ice wall is what
            explorers have named Antarctica. Beyond the ice wall is a topic of great interest to the Flat Earth
            Association. To our knowledge, no one has been very far past the ice wall and returned to tell of their
            journey. What we do know is that it encircles most of the earth and serves to hold in our oceans and helps
            protect us from whatever lies beyond. However due to climate change, some of our oceans escape.</p>

        <p>Here is picture of a proposed, but certainly not definitive, Flat Earth. Other maps representing various Flat
            Earth models can be found on our Flat Earth Maps page.</p>
