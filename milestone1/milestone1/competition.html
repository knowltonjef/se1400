    <h4>
        Who is the competion and what are they doing right?
    </h4>
    <p>
        The biggest competition would be the main three bike shops within the greater St George area that service bikes
        along with selling them, namely Red Rock Bicycles, Bicycles Unlimited, and Rapid Cycling.
        All three of these shops have been in business for over ten years at the minimul and have been able to build up
        a clientele of return customers by providing the necessary services to maintain and repair bikes.

    <h4>
        What is the competition doing wrong and how could I do it better?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Some things that they could improve on is being more personable and friendly with their clients/customers and
        providing fast turn around.
        Being a small business that is just starting out, I would be able to provide a friendly and quick same day turn
        around on services to help build up a reputation of fast turn around with quality work.
